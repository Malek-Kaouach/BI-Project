# BI Project Description

## 1/ Project aims:

The aim of this project is to extract, clean, analyze and visualize the dataset by studying the pattern of the distribution of films and Tv shows on Netflix that are able to provide better insights for researchers on what content is available in different countries and which type of movie or Tv shows is popular and most produced.

Besides that, we want to prepare a network analysis of the most interesting directors and find if Netflix has focused more on TV shows than movies in recent years.

## 2/ Project objective:

The main objective of this project is to:
* Analyze and gain insight into the kind of content available in the Netflix Database based on type, age, duration, geographic location.
* Find how many shows are added annually based on their types.
* Find the most popular directors

## 3/ About the data set:
The dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with
details such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

## 4/ Problem statement:

* Due to rough competition in the show's production market, directors had to challenge themselves in making a movie genre that is suitable for everyone.
* Most directors are unsure on what type of movies that can attract a large audience.
* Most directors are unsure of what age category they should focus on to gain views.
